Oorah Modpack Source files

Mod file and SGA file contain changes which should autoload when you open these with CoH2 Attribute Editor found in the Company of Heroes 2 Tools on steam. This version is made pre-64 bit update which means some changes may have been corrupted and unchangeable. Due to this, you may need to disable and reassign certain units 
or you'll end up playing geometry dash with unloaded units spawning as blue boxes.
