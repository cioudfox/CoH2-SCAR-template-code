64-bit CoH fix for World Builder:

- If you are attempting to run World builder after the 64 bit update, your World Builder may be missing or not compatible with the current version.
- If you are missing World builder, follow these steps below
     1) Go to the Steam page for Company of heroes 2
     2) Locate the "Settings" gear icon, and select "Properties"
     3) Select the Betas tab and select the "legacy_32 - Old Windows version of COH2"
     4) Hit apply. The World builder as well as Archive.exe should now be in your "steamapps/common/Company of Heroes 2" Folder
     5) Cut/Copy the 2 files into a separate folder and switch your Beta version back to "None"
     6) Paste the 2 files back into your "steamapps/common/Company of Heroes 2" folder
     7) Complete! You can now run world builder and build your own maps

Troubleshooting:
- If you cannot find the Archive.exe file, I have attached it in this folder:
- Feel free to run it through virusscan if you want to confirm for your safety.
- I highly suggest use the above instructions to retrieve both files as you will most likely be missing World Builder
