Fun 4v4 Custom High Resources map. Teams either defend or assault a fortress. Custom units spawn for the attackers every 4 minutes making intense fights at all 3 bridges. 

Made improvements by removing problematic map assets that destabilized the map after the update to 64 bit. Skybox is still messed up, but I can't remove it without causing other issues. Will occasionally recreate LA traffic on bridges if you fill your team with 3 other easy AIs.

If you want the SGB file, just use the coh2 tools and archive viewer then extract it from your Documents/My Games/CoH2/Scenario folder
